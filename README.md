# Group-1-Project-2 : ETL 

As a part of this collaborative project, we were required to source, transform and load the data to the SQL database for the purpose of data analysis.
Acting as a team of data engineer on this ETL project, we were required to source the datasets that will investigate UK Road Traffic Collision for the period of 2005-2017. After sourcing we transformed by cleaning the datasets and uploaded to the Postgresql for further analysis by the Data Ananlytics Team.

First and foremost, i inspected the CSV files at hand and sketched out an ERD (entity relationship diagram) of the data employing a free online tool (http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).


# Data Extraction - 
### (1) Data Source: UK Road Traffic Collision for the period of 2005-2017 obtained. 
    (2) This dataset had two datasets consisting of (a) accident_data.csv and (b) vehicle_data.csv. 
    (3) Owing to the large size of these datasets, we were unable to upload the files to GitHub
    (4) We have provided the link to download the files if required - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salmankhaliq22/road-traffic-collision-dataset

# Disclaimer: 
  (1) In order for every team members contribution to be counted towards final assessment, we have not taken any of the files from this repository out.             
  (2) Instead we are including a list of files that needs to be considered towards the final assesment of this project.
