# Group-1-Project-2 : ETL 

As a part of this collaborative project, we were asked to source, transform and load the data to the SQL database for the purpose of data analysis.

# Data Extraction - 
Acting as a team of data engineers on this ETL project, we were required to source the datasets that will investigate UK Road Traffic Collision for the period of 2005-2017. After sourcing the dataset, we transformed the datasets and uploaded to the Postgresql (Accident_db) for further analysis by the Data Ananlytics Team.
   (1) Data Source: UK Road Traffic Collision for the period of 2005-2017 obtained. 
   (2) This dataset had two datasets consisting of (a) accident_data.csv and (b) vehicle_data.csv. 
   (3) Owing to the large size of these datasets, we were unable to upload the files to GitHub.
   (4) We have provided the link to the datasets - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salmankhaliq22/road-traffic-collision-dataset
   
# ETL Pipeline - 
The ETL Pipeline employed for this project is presented as follows -

# ERD -
We inspected the CSV files at hand and sketched out an ERD (entity relationship diagram) of the data employing a free online tool (http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).
